## Prediction + fairness

- Build models that perform well *and* are transparent about trade-offs
- Emphasize calibration, subgroup performance, and equitable utility
- Pair algorithmic outputs with decision thresholds that are defensible

::: {.callout-note}
**Goal:** decisions that are both accurate and equitable.
:::

## Complex Bayesian hierarchical models

- Multi-level structure to share information across sites, groups, and time
- Partial pooling to stabilize estimates in sparse regimes
- Rich latent processes for detection, transmission, and reporting

::: {.fragment}
**Why it matters:** hierarchical structure turns noisy, incomplete data into actionable signals.
:::

---

## Imperfect detection: the core challenge

- Observed data are often a filtered version of the truth
- Detection depends on resources, behavior, and system delays
- Models must explicitly separate *process* from *observation*

::: {.callout-important}
Imperfect detection is not a nuisance—it is the mechanism that shapes what we can observe.
:::

## Application: SEIR models with imperfect detection

- Embed detection sub-models inside compartmental dynamics
- Jointly infer incidence and observation processes
- Quantify uncertainty in both transmission and reporting

::: {.fragment}
**Outcome:** more realistic forecasts and robust scenario planning.
:::

---

## Application: detecting call spikes

- Treat call volume as a latent process with observation noise
- Hierarchical priors borrow strength across regions and time
- Real-time detection focuses on *signals of change* rather than raw counts

::: {.fragment}
**Outcome:** faster identification of operational strain and emerging issues.

## Model workflow

1. Define the scientific question and action thresholds
2. Build hierarchical structure for stability
3. Encode detection/measurement processes
4. Validate with posterior predictive checks
5. Communicate uncertainty clearly

---

## Current focus areas

- Fairness-aware evaluation for predictive tools
- Robust estimation under imperfect detection
- Forecasting pipelines for infectious disease and operational signals
- Bridging model outputs to real decisions

---

## Looking ahead

- Integrating causal reasoning with hierarchical prediction
- Adaptive monitoring for rapid response
- Decision support that anticipates equity impacts
