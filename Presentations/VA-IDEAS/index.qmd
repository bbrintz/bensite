::: {.fragment fragment-index=2}
- Two examples of work in progress:
  - Stochastic SEIR models that incorporate imperfect detection - Covid-19
  - Early detection of call spikes - United Way 211 Calls (Food Insecurity Resources)

::: {.fragment fragment-index=1}
::: {.callout-note}
S(usceptible) E(xposed) I(nfectious) R(emoved) models are a class of compartmental models used in epidemiology to simulate the spread of infectious diseases through populations.
:::
:::


---

## Case study 1: Covid-19 is not perfectly reported

- Latent disease transmission is never directly observed
- Reported cases reflect testing intensity, reporting practices, and asymptomatic disease
- Naïve models conflate reporting behavior with transmission dynamics (Identifiability)


**Key capability:** separates what is happening from what is observed.


---

## Why simple SEIR models struggle

- Assume reported cases are a direct proxy for infections
- Treat transmission as independent across time and regions
- Underestimate uncertainty when data are sparse or delayed

---

## A hierarchical Bayesian solution

- Latent SEIR compartmental process for true infections
- Transmission follows a hierarchical AR(1) process over time
- Overdispersed state transitions capture real population heterogeneity
- Detection is modeled as a single global reporting fraction

::: {.fragment}
**Modeling strategy:** constrain what should be smooth, allow flexibility where variability is real.
:::

---

## Case study 2: Early detection of call spikes

- Call counts follow a zero-inflated negative binomial process
- Explicitly separates true zero-demand days from low-volume noise
- Overdispersion captures variability beyond simple Poisson assumptions

::: {.fragment}
**Modeling choice:** distribution matches real call behavior rather than forcing Gaussian assumptions.
:::

---

## Hierarchical modeling for early warning

- Latent call intensity evolves smoothly via an AR(1) process
- Seasonal patterns captured with Fourier components
- AR(1) structure and regularized effects stabilize estimates across time

::: {.fragment}
**Capability:** detects change against strong seasonal and weekly structure.
:::

---

## Detecting anomalies without hard thresholds

- Smooth change-points modeled as logistic ramps
- A horseshoe prior learns how many structural changes are needed
- A random shock component captures short-lived anomalies

::: {.fragment}
**Why this works:** the model adapts complexity to the data instead of fixing it in advance.
:::

---

## What unifies this work

- Latent-process Bayesian models with temporal dependence
- Flexible distributions matched to real-world data
- Early detection through probabilistic change modeling

---

## Current focus areas

- Early detection under delayed, zero-inflated, and overdispersed data
- Adaptive hierarchical models for evolving systems
- Decision-focused uncertainty rather than point predictions

---

## Looking ahead

- Integrating causal reasoning with hierarchical prediction
- Adaptive monitoring for rapid response
- Decision support that anticipates equity impacts
