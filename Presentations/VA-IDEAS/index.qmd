::: {.fragment}
- A shared modeling philosophy
- Two concrete instantiations of the same modeling core:
  - Imperfect detection SEIR models
  - Early detection of call spikes
:::

::: {.fragment}
::: {.callout-note}
Everything that follows focuses on two concrete models that illustrate how hierarchical Bayesian thinking enables early detection under uncertainty.
:::

---

## Case study 1: Imperfect detection SEIR models

- Latent disease transmission is never directly observed
- Reported cases reflect testing intensity and reporting practices (a noisy fraction of true infections)
- The model estimates transmission and a single global detection fraction from the data

::: {.fragment}
**Key capability:** separates what is happening from what is observed.
:::

---

## Complex Bayesian hierarchical models

- Latent SEIR compartmental process for true infections
- Transmission rate follows a hierarchical AR(1) process over time
- Transmission and state transitions vary by region with partial pooling
- Detection is modeled as a global process shared across regions

::: {.fragment}
**Modeling choice:** smooth temporal evolution captures real transmission dynamics without chasing noise.
:::

---

## Modeling uncertainty in infection dynamics

- Exposure and progression are heterogeneous across populations
- Transitions between S→E, E→I, and I→R are overdispersed
- Beta–binomial–style overdispersion allows realistic variability in state transitions

::: {.fragment}
**Capability:** absorbs unmodeled heterogeneity while preserving interpretability.
:::

---

## Imperfect detection: the core challenge

- Surveillance systems observe cases, not infections
- Detection depends on testing capacity and reporting practices
- Ignoring detection leads to biased transmission inference

::: {.callout-important}
Detection is not noise—it is a structured, inferential component of the model.
:::

---

## Application: SEIR models with imperfect detection

- Jointly infers transmission, detection, and transition processes
- AR(1) structure stabilizes inference during reporting gaps
- Remains well-behaved when case counts approach zero

::: {.fragment}
**Result:** smoother, more credible early warning signals for emerging outbreaks.
:::

---

## One modeling philosophy, different signals

- Separate latent process from noisy observations
- Use hierarchical structure to borrow strength
- Target early detection rather than point prediction

---

## Case study 2: Early detection of call spikes

- Call counts follow a zero-inflated negative binomial process
- Explicitly separates true zero-demand days from low-volume noise
- Overdispersion captures variability beyond simple Poisson assumptions

::: {.fragment}
**Modeling choice:** distribution matches real call behavior rather than forcing Gaussian assumptions.
:::

---

## Hierarchical modeling for early warning

- Latent call intensity evolves smoothly via an AR(1) process
- Seasonal patterns captured with Fourier components
- AR(1) structure and regularized effects stabilize estimates across time

::: {.fragment}
**Capability:** detects change against strong seasonal and weekly structure.
:::

---

## Detecting anomalies without hard thresholds

- Smooth change-points modeled as logistic ramps
- A horseshoe prior learns how many structural changes are needed
- A random shock component captures short-lived anomalies

::: {.fragment}
**Why this works:** the model adapts complexity to the data instead of fixing it in advance.
:::

---

## What unifies this work

- Latent-process Bayesian models with temporal dependence
- Flexible distributions matched to real-world data
- Early detection through probabilistic change modeling

---

## Current focus areas

- Early detection under delayed, zero-inflated, and overdispersed data
- Adaptive hierarchical models for evolving systems
- Decision-focused uncertainty rather than point predictions

---

## Looking ahead

- Integrating causal reasoning with hierarchical prediction
- Adaptive monitoring for rapid response
- Decision support that anticipates equity impacts
