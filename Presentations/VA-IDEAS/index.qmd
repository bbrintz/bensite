## Prediction + fairness

- Build models that perform well *and* are transparent about trade-offs
- Emphasize calibration, subgroup performance, and equitable utility
- Pair algorithmic outputs with decision thresholds that are defensible

::: {.callout-note}
**Goal:** decisions that are both accurate and equitable.
:::

## How I think about modeling problems

- Real-world data are messy, incomplete, and biased
- Systems usually have *structure* (people, places, time)
- Decisions still have to be made, even when data are imperfect

::: {.callout-note}
**My focus:** building models that respect how data are generated and support better decisions, not just better predictions.
:::

## Example: understanding disease spread

- We want to know: *how many people are really getting sick?*
- But we only see reported cases, tests, or hospital visits
- These depend on access, behavior, and reporting systems

::: {.fragment}
**Modeling goal:** separate what is happening from what is being observed.
:::

---

## Key features of the disease models

- **Disease dynamics:** people move through stages (exposed → infectious → recovered)
- **Hierarchical transmission:** trends can differ by site, but share information
- **Time-varying spread:** transmission can change with behavior or interventions

::: {.callout-note}
This avoids treating each location as either identical or completely independent.
:::

---

## Imperfect detection (what we see is not the whole story)

- Not everyone who is sick gets tested or seeks care
- Reporting changes with access, policies, and system strain
- Models include a *detection layer* on top of true infections

::: {.callout-important}
This helps distinguish real changes in spread from changes in reporting.
:::

---

## What we gain from this structure

- Separate estimates of transmission and detection
- More stable estimates when data are sparse or noisy
- Uncertainty that reflects both biology and reporting systems

::: {.fragment}
This leads to better situational awareness, not just better curve‑fitting.
:::

---

## Key features of call‑spike models

- **Baseline patterns:** daily and weekly rhythms in call volume
- **Anomaly detection:** identifying sudden departures from normal behavior
- **Trend shifts:** detecting sustained increases over time

::: {.callout-note}
We care about both short‑term shocks and longer‑term overload.
:::

---

## How monitoring models support action

- Estimate probability of an anomaly or trend change
- Quantify how large the increase is, not just whether it exists
- Combine evidence to trigger operational responses

::: {.callout-important}
This reduces false alarms while still catching true surges early.
:::

---

## A common approach across projects

1. Start from the real-world question
2. Think about how the data are actually generated
3. Build models that reflect that process
4. Check whether the model reproduces reality
5. Present results in decision‑relevant terms

---

## Why Bayesian and hierarchical?

- Natural way to combine multiple sources of uncertainty
- Supports partial pooling when some areas have little data
- Produces probabilities that map directly to decisions

::: {.callout-note}
This is especially valuable when stakes are high and data are limited.
:::

---

## Current focus areas

- Supporting fair and equitable decision tools
- Understanding disease dynamics with incomplete data
- Monitoring systems for early warning signals
- Translating model outputs into operational guidance

---

## Looking ahead

- Integrating causal reasoning with hierarchical prediction
- Adaptive monitoring for rapid response
- Decision support that anticipates equity impacts

## Thank you

Questions or collaborations welcome — especially where uncertainty + equity matter for real decisions.
